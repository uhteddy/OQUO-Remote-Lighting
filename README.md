# OQUO Remote Lighting
> This project is in development and has no stable release. Please do not expect anything to be functional at this point in time.

## Introduction
Welcome to the OQUO Remote Lighting repository. I would like to tell you what this application does. Lighting within roblox is hard to maintain and create. This is why OQUO wanted to create a functioning desktop application to allow you to control your lights in-game remotely from our system along with saving cue's.

### How to download
> The current verions are only supported on Windows. When a production version is released we will expand this to mac OS.
> 
Go to the [releases](https://github.com/uhteddy/OQUO-Remote-Lighting/releases) page and download the latest version. 

**IMPORTANT:** When downloading the application you will be promted with a windows titled `Windows protected your PC`. Do not worry about this as this is only happening because I did not purchase a code signature so that windows can confirm that this is an official application. I might purchase one at another time but for now just press *Run Anyways*.

# Support me
It's not free to create software for everyone. I want to make my systems free so that everyone can enjoy the fun in creativity but creativity does not equal income. I currently need to pay for a backend for this project and need help to cut those costs.
